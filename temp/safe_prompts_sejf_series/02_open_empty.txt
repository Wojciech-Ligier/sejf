Create a single flat vector cartoon icon on a transparent background (PNG, 1024×1024). Centered composition, front view, orthographic. Do not insert any background, floor, gradients, textures, text, or drop shadows.

• Hinges: on the right side, visible, #727D8A.
• Handle wheel: centered on the door, gold #D4AF37 with 6 spokes; spindle #B08C2D.
• Keypad: small rectangle at the door’s top-right; fill #222222; 3×3 dots #A7B4C3.
• Interior (when visible): cavity fill #1F2630 with 6 px inner rim stroke #2B2B2B.
• Line style: uniform 6 px outlines; minimal flat shading using one darker tone #8C99A6 along the door edge only.

Generator parameters (if available): aspect ratio 1:1; seed 4242; style “flat vector cartoon”; output PNG with alpha; no background.

Scene: DOOR OPEN at 110° swinging to the viewer’s right (hinges on right). Show a narrow 6 px hinge gap. Interior cavity visible (fill #1F2630, inner rim stroke #2B2B2B). Inside the safe there is NOTHING—completely empty.
