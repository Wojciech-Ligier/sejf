Create a single flat vector cartoon icon on a transparent background (PNG, 1024×1024). Centered composition, front view, orthographic. Do not insert any background, floor, gradients, textures, text, or drop shadows.

• Interior (when visible): cavity fill #1F2630 with 6 px inner rim stroke #2B2B2B.
• Line style: uniform 6 px outlines; minimal flat shading using one darker tone #8C99A6 along the door edge only.

Generator parameters (if available): aspect ratio 1:1; seed 4242; style “flat vector cartoon”; output PNG with alpha; no background.

Scene: DOOR OPEN at 110° to the right. Inside the cavity place TWO items: (a) the polaroid photo (spec as above) in the back, and (b) the A4 document (spec as above) slightly overlapping in front. No third item.
