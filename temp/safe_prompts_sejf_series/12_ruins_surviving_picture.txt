Create a single flat vector cartoon icon on a transparent background (PNG, 1024×1024). Centered composition, front view, orthographic. Do not insert any background, floor, gradients, textures, text, or drop shadows.

Design specs (use exactly these in every image of this series):
• Safe body: square with 28 px corner radius; outer stroke 6 px #2B2B2B; body fill #B0B7C3; door fill #8C99A6.
• Hinges: on the right side, visible, #727D8A.
• Handle wheel: centered on the door, gold #D4AF37 with 6 spokes; spindle #B08C2D.
• Keypad: small rectangle at the door’s top-right; fill #222222; 3×3 dots #A7B4C3.
• Interior (when visible): cavity fill #1F2630 with 6 px inner rim stroke #2B2B2B.
• Line style: uniform 6 px outlines; minimal flat shading using one darker tone #8C99A6 along the door edge only.

Generator parameters (if available): aspect ratio 1:1; seed 4242; style “flat vector cartoon”; output PNG with alpha; no background.

Scene: Same ruined safe as in file 09. Inside the cavity, place ONE INTACT polaroid photo icon: white frame #FFFFFF, inner #49C5B6, mountain #2F9C90, sun #F6D74A. The photo is clean and undamaged amid light soot in the cavity.
